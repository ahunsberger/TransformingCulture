# TransformingCulture
Presentation and materials for Transforming Culture with DevOps Principles Talk. This changes each time I give it, so notable differences are listed out. 

This has been given in some form at the following venues:
* TISQA (Feb 2018)
* SauceCon (Mar 2018)
* Quality Jam (Apr 2018)
* DevOps West (Jun 2018)
* TriTaug Meetup (Oct 2018) - first time adding exercises

# Slides
Github is yelling at me for trying to upload a 90 MB file. So, here are some links!

* [Presentation with Exercises PPTX](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Q0g1tra766Rzv09Zgg8OzTO2GRBu2x0H) - full speaker notes (and duplicate slides to break them up)
* [Presentation with Exercises PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Kg5RB8-BbB42EVlhuQlxD942ogvuPY1F) - no speaker notes, no duplicate slides 
* [Exercise Worksheets PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E_0dIlgGEA1y3sdXoZg6Bb89Wpd4oM3I) - these are also listed individually above
